        Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is enabled in Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or subtask to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue properties set.

        The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

        Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

         *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
         *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

        In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the parent and child are members of the same project.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project in which the issue or subtask is created.
      operationId: createIssue
      parameters:
        - description: Whether the project in which the issue is created is added to the user's **Recently viewed** project list, as shown under **Projects** in Jira. When provided, the issue type and request type are added to the user's history for a project. These values are then used to provide defaults on the issue create screen.
